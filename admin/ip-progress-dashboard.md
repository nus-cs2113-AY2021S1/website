* Details about iP grading are [here]({{ baseUrl }}/admin/ip-grading.html).
* Note that the progress shown here is just a rough guidance as it was generated by an automated script. ==A human inspection will be done after the final submission== to confirm the script's findings.
* If an increment you did does not appear as 'done' in this page, make sure you have pushed the corresponding tag to your fork and the tag matches the increment name exactly. You can even tag past commits if you forgot to tag those commits earlier or the tag you used differs from the expected tag. The increment will be marked as 'done' at the next script run (it runs once per week).
* Meaning of colors/icons:
  * %%{{ icon_info }}%% : you can click on this icon to find more info
  * <span class="badge badge-success">ABC</span> : you have done the corresponding item.
  * <span class="badge badge-info">ABC</span> : you have done the corresponding item which is an optional item (well done!).
  * <span class="badge badge-danger">~~ABC~~</span> : you have not done the corresponding item yet.
  * <span class="badge badge-secondary">~~ABC~~</span> : item due soon, not done yet.
* If you have queries about the data shown in this page, please email `{{ module | lower }}@comp.nus.edu.sg`.

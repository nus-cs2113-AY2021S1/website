[{{ icon_individual }}]: Evaluate the feature done by the student for difficulty/depth  and completeness.<br>
Scale: [`L`: Low, B- and below][`M`: Medium, B][`H`: High, B+/A-][`polished`: A/A+]

**Difficulty/Depth**:
- ( ) `L`: e.g., 1. make the existing _find_ command case insensitive <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. CRUD for a simple entity type just like Person 
      that is not connected to any other entity type
- ( ) `M`:   Examples: 1. a moderately difficult new command that is not similar to existing commands. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. a new entity type moderately different from Person and 
      lightly connected to other entity types.
- ( ) `H`: e.g., a) A high-level of natural language support b) A deep integration with another product c)
       An enhancement that makes the product good enough to take to the market d) A new entity type very different from
       Person and deeply connected to many other entity types

**Completeness**:
- ( ) `L`: A partial implementation of the feature. Barely useful.
- ( ) `M`: The feature has enough functionality to be useful for some of the users.
- ( ) `H`: The feature has all functionality to be useful to almost all users 
      AND Some optimization for keyboard users e.g., easy-to-type syntax.

**Other**: `polished`: The feature looks _polished_ i.e., A/A+.

<div style="font-size:20px">

Scale: [`L`: Low, B- and below][`M`: Medium, B+/A-][`H`: High, A/A+]

**Target user**:
- [ ] `target user specified and appropriate`: The target user is clear and not too general 
      (should be narrowed to a specific user group with certain characteristics).
- [ ] `value specified and matching`: The value offered by the product is clearly specified
      and matches the target user.

**Value to the target user**:  
- ( ) `L`: The value to target user is low. App is not worth using.
- ( ) `M`: Some small group of target users might find the app worth using.
- ( ) `H`: one of the below:
  * Most of the target users are likely to find the app worth using.
  * It feels like a fast typist can be more productive with the app, compared to an equivalent GUI app without a CLI.

**Feature-fit**:
- ( ) `L`: Features don't seem to fit together.
- ( ) `M`: Some features fit together but some don't.
- ( ) `H`: All features fit together.

**Other**:
- [ ] `polished`: The product looks well-designed i.e., A/A+

- [ ] Started with good overview
- [ ] Reasonable flow
- [ ] No evidence of 'winging it' (i.e., some level of prior planning is evident)
- [ ] Used realistic data
- [ ] Used enough test data %%i.e., more data than visible in the list view%%
- [ ] No unexpected bugs popped up during the demo
- [ ] Finished within time

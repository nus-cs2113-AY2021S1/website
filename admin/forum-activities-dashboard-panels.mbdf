> Yes. The page limit takes into account that a significant amount of space is wasted by the template. Try to make the PPP concise; peer evaluators are not going to like it if you make them read a lot. Same applies for other 'tricks' such as using small fonts or narrow margins. It's not enough to meet the page limit in theory; you should also meet it in spirit -- i.e., make the content concise. If the content is concise, evaluators are unlikely to fault you for going over the page limit slightly.

> Good question @Zhilin-Huang
> Consider a case of a while-loop in the code. An execution path that does only one iteration through the loop executes all statements in the loop, achieving 100% statement coverage. But that does not mean _all unique paths through the loop_ have been executed because a path that does only one iteration in the loop is different from another path that does two iterations in the loop.

I see! So does this mean that in the case that we have a while-loop, we can never achieve 100% path coverage because executing 1, 2, 3... n iterations are considered different paths?

My understanding for this problem is that: Previously, there is no data/duke.txt. When we first run duke, it will be created. Therefore, we may need to add code to create a data folder and a duke.txt. This may solve both jar problem and test-ui problem?

I made a costly mistake by creating a branch from one of my branches instead of from the master branch. As a result, when I created the PRs and tried to merge, the results were disastrous.

I have then tried to delete the changes manually and make a new commit to "undo" the change since I don't think it is possible to revert commits on GitHub. After this, I did the merging of the PRs correctly and also tagged the merge commits.

Hi, on behalf of the OP, this is the commit where our team last edited the code that had to do with scanning of user input: 
[Link to commit](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113T-T13-1/tp/commit/225e70a3d37bb2d16036bf502fad3d28b95ded1c)

It seems I have resolved the issue by changing the path to 'dir /b duke-0.0.1.jar' in the runtest.bat file where it was previously 'dir /b *.jar'. I don't think it was an issue with the Scanner like IntelliJ was warning about, it seemed no matter how I changed the code, it kept warning about the same line of code even though that line only contained a curly bracket.

I have just merged a PR which passes all the CI tests.

EDIT: Not very sure why shadowJar creates two different jar files in the build/libs directory, of which only one works (duke-0.0.1.jar)

I think that is what you need. finalize() is called before the garbage collector tries to release the unreferenced object memory, and you can put the decrement of the static class variable in the finalize() method. But when the garbage collector works is totally up to jvm, even you reference an object to null, the JVM may start garbage collection only when it runs out of memory. so the finalize method may not be called throughout the entire programme running time.
Correct me if I am wrong.

createNewFile will try to create the file according to the path you have specified in the File object. If the directory your jar file is located in does not have a subfolder path "src/main/java/data", it will throw an error. So maybe you could try to see how you can rectify this error.

Relative path points to the path of the file relative to your current location/directory.  So say if I'm in "./src/main" and I want to access "./src/main/java/duke/duke.txt", the relative path would be "java/duke/duke.txt". 

For the jar case, you could run it in an empty directory eg "test". So for this example, the jar file will try to locate the saved tasklist file in whatever relative path you specified ie "test/\<relativepath\>"

I think it depends not so much on the access modifier but the level of encapsulation and whether the rest of the program outside the class has a reference to it. Taking an example from an SO post:

**Composition**
```
class Car {

  private final Engine engine;

  Car(EngineSpecs specs) {
    engine = new Engine(specs);
  }

  void move() {
    engine.work();
  }
}
```
Notice how the Car constructor creates an Engine object that exists only within the Car object. When the Car is destroyed, the Engine must be destroyed as well. (in your Email example, the Email and Subjects have a 'part-of' relationship meaning they co-depend on each other)

**Aggregation**
```
final class Car {

  private Engine engine;

  void setEngine(Engine engine) {
    this.engine = engine;
  }

  void move() {
    if (engine != null)
      engine.work();
  }
}
```
For this example, I can create a Car object at a certain time, then put in an Engine into that Car at a later time. The Engine object doesn't exist exclusively within the Car, and there is some way to reference it from outside. So when the Car is destroyed, the Engine can still exist and maybe be put into another Car. (like for your Team example, a Person can still live even if his Team is disbanded) In the example, there isn't a constructor but if there was, it probably wouldn't specify the Engine attribute at creation time.

I could be wrong, please feel free to correct me!

I feel that it refers to the latter as well. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQnytAeZrWE#t=16m15s In the diagram that he draws, he describes the function calls to the OS as the external couplings rather than between different functions. So a change in 1 function call wouldn't necessarily affect the other function call couplings, whereas if they changed the OS all the function call couplings would have to change as well.

The following error occurs when I enter more than 1 line in input.txt. Im not sure why this is happening and what I can do to solve it.

I tried methods recommended by other forum posts such as deleting old jar files and running gradlew clean but nothing seems to work. Would really appreciate any help. Thanks!!!

Hi everyone. I am facing a really weird issue and I honestly have no idea why it is happening.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51941453/76331093-a1f1aa80-6329-11ea-9382-5f2ffc291e72.png)

In the attached picture is a snippet of my code with a few checks to see how it prints. I would expect "Check 1" to be printed before I enter the user input but it only gets printed after scanning in userAge which is very weird. The same happens for userGender, where "Check 3" gets printed after the input.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51941453/76330897-5a6b1e80-6329-11ea-96a9-92b14005c10a.png)

When I change all the println() statements to print() statements it ends up becoming weirder as they do not get printed until all the inputs have been entered. May I know why this is the case and why this happens? Because it does not make much sense to me personally.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51941453/76330986-779fed00-6329-11ea-9c41-5aa66fa75c72.png)

This issue seems simple enough but I have no idea why it's happening this way. Hopefully, someone would be able to help me out :)

This was what I used previously. I actually redid a lot of my code so it looks different now.
The brute force rewriting of the file was just a temporary measure as I was more focused on getting the reading and saving parts to work.

I have a related question regarding Composition and Aggregation. Based on the above example, its shown that there is an obvious difference between the 2, where

However, it was also mentioned in the textbook that the aggregation symbol can be omitted.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51941453/76787765-a1a75280-67f4-11ea-95f6-4792eda87551.png)

Would it be possible for an aggregation symbol to be replaced with a composition symbol?
For example, in the example above, where a "whole-part" relationship is not present. Is replacing the aggregation with a composition be wrong in this case?

This also applies for the example in the textbook:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51941453/76788020-1d090400-67f5-11ea-8b26-1ef5c0946d30.png)
where removing the club doesn't actually remove the person as well, and thus a whole-part relationship is not observed. Can the aggregation be replaced with a composition in this case?

Oh noted, thanks for the reply. So am I correct to assume that if we were told to not use aggregation we should in fact be replacing all non-whole-part relationships with normal associations? Which means that only strong whole-part relationships should be labelled with composition while all container-contained relationships are labelled with an aggregation/association?

I have a related question regarding coupling. If I have multiple classes utilising the same static class, is that considered high coupling? For example, multiple command classes utilising methods from a static class. 

Alternatively, what if those multiple classes are utilising methods from another class (an instantiated object)? For example, multiple command classes utilising methods from an object passed in as a parameter. 

Is there a difference if the class is static or not?

GitHub uses a version of Markdown called [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/), which implements things in a slightly different way than standard Markdown. [This section in particular](https://github.github.com/gfm/#why-is-a-spec-needed-) talks about the `<p>` HTML tag.

A couple suggestions:
- There may be an issue with the cache for the GitHub Pages page; you can try `Shift + F5` to load the page again, ignoring the cached content
- If you 're linking your images using their relative path, you could try using their absolute paths instead (or viceversa)

Hi everyone, I am having some issues passing the Java CI / build for my PR. Specifically, the check that fails is the 'Perform IO redirection test (*NIX)' part. You can view it here: [https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-4/tp/pull/28/checks?check_run_id=505277833].

I understand that Java uses garbage collector and thus, there is no need for destructor methods. But without destructors, how can I know the total number of objects within a class during runtime? For eg, if I can only increment the number of objects in the constructor method but not decrement it under the destructor method, wouldn't the total count be inaccurate if an unreferenced object gets garbage collected without decrementing total object count explicitly?

With regards to this arrow, The instructions for ActionFactory is: creates ActionsX, ActionY objects and adds them to the History object. 
Since ActionFactory did not specify that History object is a member object within its class, the History object is transient within ActionFactory and the arrow should be a dotted arrow indicating ActionFactory depends on **History** as well as ActionX and ActionY.

Hi, I've encountered this issue too. It could be caused by an old jar file in your local build/lib directory, resulting in a false positive test pass. Try deleting the old jar and making a new jar via gradle shadowJar, after which your local test would be similar to the CI tool and you can fix accordingly.

However, due to the recent incorrect merges as can be seen above where i incorrectly merge master into all branches, all of them now contain the same code as master which is the most recent increment A-Release.

I have followed the instructions given under the Week 2 Project tab to set up the project. After making changes for increment Level-1, committing and pushing it, I realised that my fork of Duke is public and I am unable to make it private without duplicating it. Can I check if we are supposed to leave it as public or otherwise? Thank you.

When I was running an iP's Jar file for evaluation using the  `java -jar {file_name}` command, I got a "java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError" which says that it has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 56.0). (Picture below)

![Jar error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42561929/76143536-24246980-60b3-11ea-9dc8-89b6a5dde8ac.PNG)

According to this website: [https://mkyong.com/java/java-lang-unsupportedclassversionerror/](url) , class file version 56 refers to JDK 12. So I'm guessing I can't run it because I'm using JDK 11. 
May I clarify how I should go about the peer evaluation? More specifically, is it ok for me to download the source files and compile it myself for testing and evaluation? Or do I evaluate the program as is (not able to run)?

I googled that it means that there is no additional argument as I compile and run the code on repl.it, which causes my code to get that error

I also meet this problem. And I find it is because there is something wrong with storage and runtest.bat. e.g, if your storage file path is `data/example.csv`, then when you run runtest.sh, it will create a folder under text-ui-test and will get `text-ui-test/data/example.csv`. But for runtest.bat, it will create a folder under `build/libs` and will get `build/libs/data/example.csv`. So I edit runtest.bat in this way:
<img width="612" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38337361/77786795-61b85900-7099-11ea-9ac6-1cb623b4cb5d.png">
And now when I run runtest.bat, the storage file will in the same folder as the runtest.sh's.

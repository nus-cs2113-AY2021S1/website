> In ShowCommand it's index - 1. shouldn't they both be the same?

I'm thinking it might be better if we deal with the `-1` when we initialize all the commands. Like for `DeleteCommand` we have `return new DeleteCommand(flashcardList, Integer.parseInt(splitInput[1]) - 1);` in `Parser.java`, so maybe we can change `ShowCommand` to ` return new ShowCommand(flashcardList, Integer.parseInt(splitInput[1] - 1), ui);` and same for `ReviewedCommand`.

I think it does not really matter for us we have 3 or 5 levels? 
Also we can have 3 levels for now and later if we think we need more, we can just add another enum field. 
For the default, we can have the `getPriorityAsString()` method to return the 'Not indicated' string

Thanks for the feedback! I'll scale the ParserAndCommandSequenceDiagram smaller. I'm a bit hesitant about including actor in the diagram though - if I want to include `Actor`, then `Main` and `Ui` will need to be added as well since `Actor` does not directly interact with `Parser`. This might be unnecessary as this section should probably focus on the `Parser` and `Command` components only hmmmm

Adding confirmation message is a good idea! Thanks for pointing out :) I'll update accordingly.

Yeah, is harmless, just that if all of us all don't bother to discard and push it for pr, this thing will keep showing a merge conflict. So just a suggestion to be consider for others to avoid having to resolve conflict due to unnecessary stuff like this. The reason why there isn't a merge conflict now is because the rest of us do take note not to push this also

I dont understand what your code does right now. 

First, you check isCommandValid, which return true when profile.isProfileExist() || command.getCommand().equals("set-profile") || command.getCommand().equals("help") || command.getCommand().equals("exit"). 

Next, when the user wants to exit but there is no profile created yet, you are going to propt the displayCreateProfileMessage which says: Please create a profile before using this command.

I don't think it is fair or even feasible to not let the user exit without creating a profile yet.

Too vague, there is currently no testing at all. So would be good if you specify what test of which classes to be exact that you doing. Also, good if each of us start off by testing on the code that we have written for the corner cases before we move on to ensure everyone's testing is comprehensive.

Hello, can I ask if you have added any ingredient named `fish`? 

You can add an ingredient using the following command: 
`addingredient /n fish /c meat /q 3 /p 20 /e 18/05/2020` 

The 3 pieces of fish that you have indicated in the `fish ball` recipe means that 3 pieces of fish are needed for the recipe, it does not mean that there are 3 pieces of recipe in the ingredients' inventory. 😆

Anyway, my testing so far shows that this message won't be seen by a user. Either the part without flag is ignored, or the user will see `flag is too short`.

Yes, I have also misunderstood the syncing of fork with the upstream repository as well.

If I understood it correctly from what you say, the correct way to pull the upstream repository to the local copy, these are the steps to follow it:

Using of SourceTree 
![upstream_setup1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42379721/75733997-b8987000-5d31-11ea-97a4-80ec01845863.jpeg)
1. Go to repository setting

![upstream_setup2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42379721/75734021-c817b900-5d31-11ea-813a-5f6aadc8dbc0.jpeg)
2. Shows you the remote repository path, add an remote path of the upstream to the setting

![upstream_setup3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42379721/75734068-e382c400-5d31-11ea-914c-415e75c26f48.jpeg)
3. Image of adding the upstream path, and clicking Ok.

![upstream_setup4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42379721/75734234-5b50ee80-5d32-11ea-811e-7cfd041c9c2d.jpeg)
4. Fetch the commits from the upstream repo and check it is correct commits

![upstream_setup5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42379721/75734477-03ff4e00-5d33-11ea-906c-0d950104e6a9.jpeg)
5. Pull the commits from the upstream repository master, this will make local changes in your local repository

6. Push the local copy repository back to your own remote repository

Using of Command Line interface [a rough idea, do check the command for these usage]
1. git remote add upstream https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113T-M16-2/tp.git
You can check by "git remote -v"
2. git fetch upstream master
3. git pull upstream master
4. git push origin master

Allowing duplicated ingredient name is intended, enables the user to type in similar product. E.g. augus beef. Example, user buy 4 different augus beef, but what do the user label them as? augus beef 1, augus beef 2, ... , and so on. 

Ingredient quantity, will fix in UG stating the actual quantity servings that it can served, so recipe and ingredient quantity has indeed the same units of measurement.

I implemented a way to sort Flashcards based on startDate to implement the timeline feature. Although I'm not really sure we need to worry about sorting the flashcards here. The main purpose of having the equals method for FlashcardList as of now (afaik) is so we can use assertEquals on FlashcardLists, and in the tests I can see it being useful that we can check the order that flashcards being inserted is the same in two FlashcardLists. If we need to have an unordered equality check in the future perhaps we can make another method for that.

oh i see.
u can just do the sorting here if u want or can make another method. whichever is easier for u i guess. Here is a code snippet for how to get a sorted list of flashcards.

List<Flashcard> flashcards = new ArrayList<>(flashcardList.getFlashcards());

I think that setupLogger needs to be called once when the program starts up, not every time we instnatiate a Command. logger is a static member so redoing the setup every time we create a new flashcard is wasteful. I think maybe we should have a method that runs at the start of the program that does set up of all the loggers.

We can see from this example that prof linked that they are calling MyLogger.setup() from main() in the last example code. What do u think?

Yeah, I think that is a good idea. I will make the factory write to the same log as the flashcards as well. I don't think the code ever reaches the unknown flashcard in the factory right now because unknown commands are handled in the Parser, but logging this could be helpful if we change things in the future.

Hello here's my suggestion for the three if-else cases :)

1. define max and min values in your budget class
final static double MAX = 5000;
final static double MIN = 0;

2. The empty constructor initializes budget to zero
public Budget(){
    this.amount = 0;
  }

3. set budget relies on min/max value (handles negative values too!) 🥂 
 public void setBudget(double amount){
    if(amount > 5000){
   this.amount = Math.min(amount,MAX);
    }else{
   this.amount = Math.max(amount,0);
    }
  }

hope this helps! 💃

I am unable to find the PR for AddPatientCommandSequence diagram but here are some comments about the diagram:
1. If I am not mistaken, forward/invoke arrows should not be dotted lines, only return arrows are dotted.
2. the loop part of diagram is quite hard to read as the arrows are squeezed, consider expanding the diagram.

> `ShowGroupsCommand` looks good to me, but I wonder a bit about the naming of the `ListGroupCommand`. When I first saw this name I thought it was for listing all the groups haha I'm thinking maybe we can consider naming it to `ListGroupFlashcardsCommand` or `ListFlashcardsInGroupCommand` but these names are a bit lengthy. What do you think?
> 
> Also in the current implementation we are identifying groups with their names directly and this might be a bit inconvenient for the users because they'll need to input the group name exactly as it is to list flashcards in a group. Maybe we can use ID to identify groups like how we did for flashcards in FlashcardList? This might require quite some change but it's less costly to do so at this stage than later.

Agreed, have made the changes. Now the user can use either name or index to display the flashcards in the group (will search for name first, if no name matches, then check for the index).

Generally looks good! Do you want to include the actor in ParserAndCommandSequenceDiagram? I think this diagram can also be scaled smaller so that the text doesn't look too big compared to the other wider diagrams.
The study plan related diagrams look good as they are, but I'm not sure if you should include something like "confirmation message" on top of the return arrow to the actor? Linking it back to Ui may seem like too much detail, but an empty return arrow seems odd as well (like the user is not receiving anything in response).

> Thanks for the feedback! I'll scale the ParserAndCommandSequenceDiagram smaller. I'm a bit hesitant about including actor in the diagram though - if I want to include `Actor`, then `Main` and `Ui` will need to be added as well since `Actor` does not directly interact with `Parser`. This might be unnecessary as this section should probably focus on the `Parser` and `Command` components only hmmmm

I think we just need to change the code into:
'''
if (module.getName().equals(moduleName) || module.getId().equals(moduleName)) {
          module.setAsDone();
}
'''
(ps: 'moduleName' here can also be ID if user input a module ID [maybe we can change the variable name of 'moduleName']. And in Module class, we can initialize 'name' and 'id' as '""' so we can omit 'module.getName() != null' here.）

Actually, I previously found that the data structure of our 'AvailableModulesList' is quite messy. You can simply understand it as there are actually two 'availableModulesList' in this class. 

- One is the 'AvailableModulesList' self which extends 'ModuleList'. 

- But I find there is another 'static ModuleList availableModulesList' in the 'AvailableModulesList' object. And the constructor add the modules in the database to this 'availableModulesList'.

 It is ok to keep the second static list in the object because it is class-level and other methods can get 'availableModulesList' easily through this class-level static variable. But it caused a problem we need to notice:

when we use 'availableModulesList.add(X)' in other method, actually it is added to the first list(self) I mentioned above. So I override the 'add' method in 'AvailableModulesList'. 
'    @Override
    public boolean add(Module module) {
        availableModulesList.add(module);
        return super.add(module);
    }'
So to solve the potential problem, you may need to override the delete method in 'AvailableModulesList'.

So I use these two `boolean` variables `isName` and `isId` to indicate whether one module's name and id is valid. Maybe the two variables' name is confusing. I will change them into `isNameValid` and `isIdValid`.

Thanks for this comment! But in this case, I noticed that in the example `addressbook-level2`, the code uses two variables `commandWord` and `arguments` to split the fullCommand. Maybe in parser, variables' name need to be a little bit general cause the parser is used to process different types of command. 😄

Yeah, but I cannot figure out a good one.😂 The `identifier` indicates users' input and it can be either module's name or module's id(code). Maybe I can change it into `userInputModule` and explain the meaning in the javadoc.

Yeah, it is true that fullCommand will be divided into two strings  at the beginning (The first String is `taskType` and the second String is `args`) And the second string will be processed later(maybe will continue to split to more strings):
The variable String `args` in `parse` method stands for all the arguments(parameter) of a fullCommand. e.g.:
in `add id/CS2113 s/19-20 Semester 2`, `args` is `id/CS2113 s/19-20 Semester 2` and there are two args(`id/CS2113` and `s/19-20 Semester`) in this `args` String. The args String will be processed (split into two String) in `processAddCommand(String args)`. I think maybe it is better to split parameters in `proccessXCommand` method because different commands needs to split the parameters in different way.

I think we can make at least two new classes which are extended from Module class. And for each class, the constructors can be different.
e.g: 
`public SelectedModule(String id, String name, String semester )`
`public AvailableModule(String id, String name, String... preReqMods)`

Perhaps we can create a SemModuleList class to record selected modules for one certain semester, like:
`public class SemModuleList extends ModuleList {`
`private String semName; ...`
And create a SelectedModuleList for all semesters, like:
`public class SelectedModuleList extends ArrayList<semModuleList> `

I think we get this problem because IS4241 is not in the `availableModulesList` and we allow users  to add modules which are not in the `availableModulesList` to semester. If we require user must add modules which are in the  `availableModulesList`（e.g cause an exception if they try to add a "illegal" one) this problem will be solved!

Looks good!  But there is an issue, when user re-add a failed module to semester, there are two modules which have the same id in semester module list. So when they try to delete the module, they may face a problem. So is it necessary to keep this function or just ask them delete failed modules first and then re-add the module.

- Fix a bug that when user re-run the app, the cc will be zero.
- Now, user can still mark a module as done again but this command will not update total cc but only change this module's grade.
- Besides, when users delete a module from sem (or delete a module from AML and this module in sem list as well), if this module isn't failed, the total cc will minus this module's credit.

e.g:
`TST1004` is A, `TST1005` is F, now the cc is 4.
if i delete `TST1004` , total cc will be 0. If I delete `TST1004`, total cc will be  still 4.

I believe it should be caused by Gradle or Junit - the original skeleton used to work but when I reverted to check it still displayed the same error. The problem is "quick-fixed" by using a println instead. Initially I thought it was because scanner was blocking, but tested false. Other methods such as buffer reader also does not work. 

Hence the solution now is to have the user input on a new line instead.

We should separate Class and Tasks because they are different things essentially. 

1. They use different data types, making the generic will cause issues. When parsing date, one is an actual date while another is a day of the week. Following your idea of converting it into a LocalDate or Date, it will not be very wise to keep inserting it (lets say run a loop to add it for 13 weeks). I personally don't think it's a good implementation to make it general and give tasks an arraylist for their date or time when they only need one variable.

I propose that they should be separate systems. So Tasks and Timetable are separate. Timetable will have its own features with class schedule. Makes it easier to list or do other operations for each.

When doing the calendar feature which counted items in tasklist, I thought it was not very practical to mix both class and task items in the same list, because attending class is different from a task. We add classes in bulk, but tasks are much more adhoc. 

As a user, I can have my timetable printed out or have it placed static else where, or even memorise it. Why have repeated items keep occurring in the task list? It will dilute the intention of having a "todo" list. 

What do you think?

My design idea:
1. Make `class`,`task` having the same stored format in taskList. A `task` can also has multiple schedule which means task can also has mutiple location, data,time. 
2. The difference is in input format for date.  
`class` and `task` accepted **time**: 11:00-1:00 a time range. This is how our calender normally designed. 
`class` accepts **date**: integer from 1-7(Mon - Sun) This will then be tranferred to the date in this week. So it will be stored like: 2020 - 04 -05
`task` accepts **date**: date format: 2020 - 04 - 05. It will also be stored like: 2020 - 04 - 05

Additional thinking:
1. Add deadline class: Since deadline may need a specific time but not a time range.
2. Add repetitive times: Since `class` may be repeated for several weeks. So do some training. 

If the time and date is modified, then the edit class @JTWang2000 will be modified, the list and delete @yuchenlichuck @rsanchez-macias  will be modified, the calender @Bencotti may also needs to be modified.

> We should separate Class and Tasks because they are different things essentially.
> 1. They use different data types, making the generic will cause issues. When parsing date, one is an actual date while another is a day of the week. Following your idea of converting it into a LocalDate or Date, it will not be very wise to keep inserting it (lets say run a loop to add it for 13 weeks). I personally don't think it's a good implementation to make it general and give tasks an arraylist for their date or time when they only need one variable.

We do not need to add them for 13 times. May add a r/times which indicate repeat times. 
> I propose that they should be separate systems. So Tasks and Timetable are separate. Timetable will have its own features with class schedule. Makes it easier to list or do other operations for each.

So you want to separate `tasks` and `class` into two completely different structure. Then it may add much word load as list,delete,edit are based on `tasks`. I want them to have similar structure so that we can also perform delete,edit,list on class.
> When doing the calendar feature which counted items in tasklist, I thought it was not very practical to mix both class and task items in the same list, because attending class is different from a task. We add classes in bulk, but tasks are much more adhoc.
I understand this. What you said make sense. Can filter out class from taskList. Also, I think it is necessary that a `tasks`should not have clashes with `class`
> As a user, I can have my timetable printed out or have it placed static else where, or even memorise it. Why have repeated items keep occurring in the task list? It will dilute the intention of having a "todo" list.
Oh. Because from my understanding, I may want to check my weekly calender. If I print the timetable, I may need to check both calender and the timetable. But if I involve everything in a calender, then I no need print but to check calender weekly. However, what you said also makes sense. 

In all, I still prefer `class` and `task` be of similar structure so that edit, delete, list command no need to adjust a lot.
However, when view in calender, it is true that users may perfer to check tasks in one calender, while class in one calender. However, their should not be clashing. 
Also, I do not know should we add `repeat times` because the calender I currently use actually has this option.

Maybe you can update the list&delete in UG first? We do not quite understand the list/delete. I am not sure if it acts as we expected. Therefore, we would like to try with list/delete by checking the UG but the current UG does not update these two commands.

We can actually simplify the delete command if you feel it is a little bit tough. 
Just specify the delete command clearly in UG is enough.
The easier version can be:
delete t/hh:mm-hh:mm: delete task within this time range
delete t/hh:mm: delete task whose time range contains this time
delete d/yyyy-mm-dd: delete task on that day

We can actually simplify the delete command if you feel it is a little bit tough.
Just specify the delete command clearly in UG is enough.
The easier version can be:
delete t/hh:mm-hh:mm: delete task within this time range
delete t/hh:mm: delete task whose time range contains this time
delete d/yyyy-mm-dd: delete task on that day

Thanks Brandon  💯. What do you think of making getTotalPatients (or even setters/getters methods) static so there won't be a need to create an instance of PatientList when we want to call these methods?

However, it is ok to keep it this way, but take note of the constructor at line 12 - 14. Because we have to construct this object to call these methods, the default constructor from 12-14 will erase the existing patientList we have. SOoooo this might be a problem in the future~

I feel like it might slightly hard because what happens if there are multiple invalid headers?

I see, thanks for the clarification. Do you think it would be better if we accept duplicate headers, but it only process the latest duplicate. 

This is because perhaps next time when the user has typed a lot of stuff, and realizes that somewhere at the front he had a typo. So instead of retyping the commands, he can simply duplicate the header with the correct information.

For example: John is 43 years old.
`addp \age 34  \name Peter  \address Pasir Ris \phone 1234567 \age 43 \name John`
The user has mistakenly entered age as 34 and name as Peter. With this, he can easily amend it by duplicating the age and name header and inputting it the correct information.

Perhaps what can be improved is the documentation, where maybe it is better to explicitly say that index is required for editing an appointment.

ParsedException was caught in the EditAppointmentCommand method and was not printing anything. Fixed by allowing it to be caught in Duke.main and calling getLocalizedMessage to print the error message. 

Note that the functionality should still remain the same. I.e. you can still edit at least one of the field time or date. However, all provided field must comply with the format.

In addition to this fix,

On inspection, the two message lines are printed by loadSavedPatients() and loadSavedAppointments(). This is due to the calling of mkdir method when the savefile for each of these methods does not exists. 

The mkdir() function behaves differently, it returns false when the save directory already exists which causes it to fail the isNewDirectoryCreated check (when in theory it should pass; for save file already existing it should then move on to creating the save file txt). Will need to adjust the program flow for these 2 methods to consider the "has directory but no files" case.

Bug resolved by adding additional OR clause into the isNewDirectoryCreated check to account for existing directory but no files inside, for all the load methods (loadAppointment, loadPatient, loadPatientID)

Hello I think we should add the variables `boolean isSUable` and `ArrayList preReqModules`.

`boolean isSUable` to see if a module can be chosen not to be counted towards the CAP.
`ArrayList preReqModules` to store a list of modules that are prerequisites to take this module.

I think it is a good idea to merge the `add` commands. Initially I was wondering if it would be problematic if the user made a mistake by not adding `s/` when using the initial `addtosem` command. 

However, after thinking about it, it should not be a problem since the initial `addtodata` command requires both `id/` and `n/`, so we could use that to differentiate even if the user forgets the `s/` portion.

Thank you for pointing this out. However, in our program, we allow the user to freely change the price of the ingredient. The reason is, the user, most likely the restaurant owner, should be able to keep up with the changing food prices easily. 

We have considered the option of making the price immutable, but that would also mean that if the owner wants to change the price, he/she has to delete and re-add the ingredient again. In view of that, we decided to go with the first option instead.

@GanapathySanathBalaji we can add in the UG that the command line has to be full scree. If users are using OS other than windows, the screen size will be different. If they use git bash CLI, it will be even smaller. To create a specific size would be harder to implement. Also, since the problem is rectified when user starts with max screen, we can inform the user accordingly in the UG.

We are currently passing the reference of private instance variables of our main class ```MeetingOrganizer``` into methods of another class ```Command```, in order to modify the private instance variables. However, this doesnt seem to be a good idea (refer to mistake #3 in https://dzone.com/articles/java-getter-and-setter-basics-common-mistakes-and), as we are modifying a private instance variable directly, outside of its class.

The right way modify a private instance variable is to use both getter and setter.  In the **getter**, return a copy of the private instance variable. In the **setter**, copy the passed values to the private instance variable. 

However in this case where it does not make sense to create ```MeetingOrganizer``` object in the ```Command``` class, we cannot use getter and setter in the ```Command``` class. Hence we are passing the reference of the private instance variables. 

Is there a better way? Or perhaps we shouldn't have a separate ```Command``` class that modifies the private instance variables of the main class ```MeetingOrganizer```?

Issue:
When MeetingList is first loaded by the `loadListFromData()` function in our main class's constructor, you're asking that i call `updateMasterSchedule()`. However, in `MeetingOrganizer.run()`, user's input will overwrite `Boolean[][] masterSchedule` due to its constructor being called, thus undoing what we did.

Suggestion:
i will implement code to load list of members with their respective schedule from *data* (in addition to current list of scheduled meetings) and call `new ScheduleHandler(ArrayList<TeamMember> teamMemberList);` to rebuild masterSchedule in ScheduleHandler class, all in the constructor of our main class.

Required action by @MeLoveCarbs 
change code in `MeetingOrganizer.run()` so that new user inputs will not overwrite data loaded from *data*, and allow input of member's name

I think we can fix this one by only loading from file at the beginning and saving to file at the end, so no file stream is open during rest of execution

(will probably still cause problems if the file is open while loading or saving, but can we fix that in any way?)

also I don't know if this is reproducible. I've had the data file open while using jikan with no problems in the past. But maybe we changed something and now it doesn't work anymore.

Actually, returning FlashcardList makes it easier to do sequential additions. 
For  example (this is a constant I use in the JUnit test),
'''
public static final FlashcardList FLASHCARD_LIST = new FlashcardList()

If we want to do sorting, we need to do it based on something. Since the indexes of the flashcards are given following the order of additions, we can not sort the list with them.
In this way, I am not quite sure how to do sorting now. Maybe we can figure this out in further version.

Yeah, I think we can use ```!this.getGroupAtIdx(idx).equals(otherGroupList.getGroupAtIdx(idx))``` here. But I guess this is because we avoid groupLists with unordered equal groups and it seems we have no need to do unordered equal check for grouplist.

And since I decide to do sorting before check the equality of flashcard lists. I think we have no need to avoid checking groups with unordered equal flashcard lists in test any more.

Maybe consider checking for the type of command first before checking input length, such that if the command is invalid, we will know why it is invalid (such as if the command is correct but empty or the command is invalid/misspelled). This is especially for Level-5 when we need to differentiate between exceptions.

Consider standardising the names of the methods instead of having 3 different verbs describing your methods i.e. "set", "create" and "add". Could become confusing to remember all the different verbs if there are more cases involved.

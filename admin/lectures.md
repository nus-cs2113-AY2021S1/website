Lectures start on time sharp and end around 15 minutes before official end time.

**Attendance**: Attendance for the ==first lecture is compulsory==.

**Handouts**: There are no handouts. All learning materials are organized around topics, are given in Web format, can be found in the [Textbook]({{baseUrl}}/se-book-adapted/index.html) section (organized by topics), and are also embedded in the {{ schedule_link }} (organized by order of coverage).

**Slides**: Our lecture slides are not suited for printing or to be used as a reference during the lecture/exams. They are only an aid for lecture delivery. Slides will be uploaded to LumiNUS *after* the lecture.
